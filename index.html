				Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace,
Molly is the singer in a band.
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.

				<h3>Goes</h3>
				</div>
				<p>
					Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store,
Buys a twenty carat golden ring.
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
and as he gives it to her she begins to sing.

		<p>
			Happy ever after in the market place,
Molly lets the children lend a hand.
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
and in the evening she's a singer with the band.
